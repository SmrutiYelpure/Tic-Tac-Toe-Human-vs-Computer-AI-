# Tic-Tac-Toe-Human-vs-Computer-AI-
This Python program allows you to play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The game is played on a 3x3 board, where players take turns placing X and O. The game ends when one player gets three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or the board is filled with no winner.
